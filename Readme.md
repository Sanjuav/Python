# Git Branching Structure

Branches allow the process to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of the repository. In this Git repository two branches are created named 'main' and 'Feature'.

- main - Contains only stable code and is the working version of the repository

- Feature - Any new features implemented are first imported into this branch, tested and merged onto the main branch.

 
 

# Feature branch
- Once a new feature needs to be implemented the existing repository is cloned onto the local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/Sanjuav/Python

```

- The new implemented feature is then pushed onto the Feature branch on the local respository and tested.
- Once the feature implemented is validated to be stable it is pushed on to the Feature branch of the GitHub web repository
- This Feature branch is then merged with the main branch by performing a pull request.
